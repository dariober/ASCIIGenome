Text Only Genome Viewer!
========================

Description
-----------

`ASCIIGenome` is a genome browser based on command line interface and designed for running from console terminals.

Since `ASCIIGenome` does not require a graphical interface it is particularly
useful for  quickly visualizing genomic data on remote servers while offering flexibility similar to popular GUI viewers like [IGV](https://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/).

**Documentation** is at [readthedocs/asciigenome](http://asciigenome.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

**Support**: Bugs, comments and issues can be reported here on [GitHub](https://github.com/dariober/ASCIIGenome/issues) or on [Biostars.org](https://www.biostars.org/).

Some key features:

* Command line input and interaction, no graphical interface, minimal installation and requirements.
* Can load multiple files in various formats.
* Can access remote files via URL or ftp address.
* Easy navigation and searching for features and sequence motifs and filtering options
* Support for BS-Seq alignment
